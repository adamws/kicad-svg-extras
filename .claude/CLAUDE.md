# Bash commands
- Prefer using just recipes over direct hatch of python commands

# Code style
- Line length 88
- No leading or trailing white spaces
- Imports only on top-level of a file

# Workflow
- Run `just fmt` and `just lint` when you’re done making a series of code changes
- When writing git commit message describe only what you changed and why.
  Do not describe intermediate struggles, things you must have fixed in the
  meantime. Just final state of changes.
